# ts-num
For now, the module will help you to check whether the number with specific base (2-36) can exist or not. For example, '-1Z3' cannot exist in binary system as it contains other symbols than '0' and '1'. On success it retuns ok_message which you can specify yourself, same with error_message. If you wish you can set return_number and on success it will just return the number (this feature is handy when you need to check input from the user and want to keep working with data if it satisfies the requirments)
